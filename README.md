# Flipkart Sales & Product Performance Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Flipkart’s sales data across products, customers, regions, and time. It helps uncover patterns in revenue, customer satisfaction, payment behavior, and return trends—empowering data-driven decisions in sales, marketing, and operations.

# Short Description / Purpose
The Flipkart Sales Dashboard enables users to explore sales performance metrics across various product categories and regions. It helps the team monitor business health, identify underperforming areas, and reveal customer behavior patterns to improve product offerings and marketing strategies.

 # Tech Stack
The dashboard was created using Power BI Desktop for visual reporting. Power Query was used for data transformation and cleanup. The final output is stored as a .pbix file and can be shared or embedded easily for stakeholder use.

# Data Source
The dataset used is a synthetic representation of Flipkart’s internal e-commerce data for one quarter, consisting of approximately 100,000 records. It contains information such as order date, product category, sub-category, seller, region, customer ratings, delivery status, discounts, payment method, units sold, return reasons, and final price.

# Business Needs Addressed
1. Sales Performance Tracking:
Flipkart needs to track how sales are performing over time across different product categories and regions. The company is particularly interested in spotting seasonal patterns or the impact of sales events, promotions, or festivals that lead to increases or decreases in performance.

2. Customer Behavior & Satisfaction:
By analyzing customer ratings and reviews, the dashboard helps understand how product quality and satisfaction levels influence sales. It also allows Flipkart to identify which products are performing well in terms of customer satisfaction, and which are underperforming.

3. Payment Method Preferences:
The company requires visibility into how customers prefer to pay—whether by UPI, credit card, or cash on delivery—and whether certain payment methods lead to higher sales volumes or satisfaction levels.

4. Regional Sales Distribution:
Flipkart wants to evaluate sales performance across Indian regions to identify cities or states with high demand and regions with growth potential. This insight can support more focused marketing and logistics planning.

# Expected Outcome
The Flipkart Sales Dashboard provides a visually rich, interactive reporting layer over critical sales and customer data. It delivers clear, actionable insights into key business metrics such as revenue, customer ratings, returns, and sales distribution. These insights enable Flipkart’s teams to make smarter decisions around inventory planning, customer service improvements, product marketing, and regional expansion.

# Walkthrough of Key Visuals
The dashboard opens with a summary of core KPIs like total revenue, number of orders, and average order value. Time-based charts reveal monthly and weekly sales trends, highlighting spikes around holidays or marketing campaigns. Users can explore product-wise sales and return rates, filter by vehicle type, or identify the most returned products. The dashboard also includes a visual breakdown of payment methods used, a map of regional sales performance, and comparisons between customer and driver ratings to assess satisfaction. Discount impact charts help measure how offers affect units sold or ratings.

# Business Impact
This dashboard empowers Flipkart to optimize pricing and discounts, refine product offerings based on satisfaction data, identify the most reliable sellers and products, and understand regional or seasonal opportunities for growth. It bridges the gap between raw data and strategic planning, helping teams act on the insights that matter most.
